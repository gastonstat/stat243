### Description and Outline

__Statistics 243__ is an introduction to statistical computing taught using R. 
The course will cover both programming concepts and statistical computing 
concepts. 

Programming concepts may include:

- data and text manipulation
- data structures
- flow control
- functions and variable scope
- regular expressions
- matrix manipulations
- debugging
- parallel processing

Statistical computing topics may include:

- numerical linear algebra
- simulation studies and Monte Carlo methods
- numerical optimization
- numerical integration/differentiation

The coverage of these topics complement the models/methods discussed
in the rest of the statistics graduate curriculum.

We will also cover the basics of UNIX/Linux, in particular some basic shell
scripting.


### Informal prerequisites

If you are not a statistics or biostatistics graduate student, please chat 
with me if you're not sure if this course makes sense for you.
A background in calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics is
expected, as well as a basic ability to operate on a computer (but not
necessary a UNIX variant).
 
Furthermore, I'm expecting you will know the basics of R, at the level
of the material in the [R bootcamp](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-2016) offered by Chris Paciorek Aug. 20-21, 2016. If you don't have that background 
you'll need to spend time in the initial couple weeks getting up to speed.


### Objectives of the Course

The goals of the course are that, by the end of the course, students be
able to:

- operate effectively in a UNIX environment
- program effectively in R with an advanced knowledge of R functionality and
 an understanding of general programming concepts; and
- be familiar with concepts and tools for reproducible research and good 
scientific computing practices; and
- understand in depth and be able to make use of principles of numerical linear
 algebra, optimization, and simulation for statistics-related research.

### Grading Structure

-  5% in-class presentation
-  5% github repositories
- 10% lab work and quizzes
- 20% homework
- 10% project 1 (individual)
- 20% project 2 (2 members)
- 30% project 3 (4 members)


### Format

This course will focus heavily on in-class participation in addition to 
assigned readings from scholarly journals, presentations from guest speakers, 
several "feedback" assignments, and weekly blog articles in addition to 
regular practice with the software tools listed in the description.

Your persistent cooperation in group work and contributions to the course 
will culminate into a collaborative term project. The format will be interactive 
and will involve your questions, opinions, and participation.


### Homework Policy

- Weekly homework assignments are due as posted online.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- After the due date of each assignment, we will discuss the solutions during class.
- No late assignments will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not limited to, theft, extraordinary circumnstances, and your pet's dietary idiosyncrasies.
- Instead of late HW, I will drop your lowest two HW scores.


### Problem Sets

Problems will sometimes be somewhat open-ended, so those coming in at different
levels may explore things with more or less sophistication.
I'm also open to you defining your own assignment for a given topic, if
you are working on a specific problem.
E.g., instead of working on a particular text manipulation problem I assign,
you might work with your own text data. Check with me before forging ahead.

We will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or Piazza
at the last minute.
Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of
time for the assignments.


### Group Project Policy

- The final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4.
- I'll assign an overall task, and you'll be responsible for dividing up
 the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation.
- You'll need to use a version control system such as Git for working in
 your group.
- All team members must be knowledgeable of other members contributions
- You will be responsible to do peer review and check each other’s work
- It’s possible to have conflicts between team members. If this happends,
you will have to solve them (don't ask me to solve your problems)


### Collaboration Policy

I encourage you to work together and help each other out, in the context
 of the following guidelines.

- In terms of questions/challenges posed in class that we'll discuss at the
 next class, anything goes.
- In terms of the problem sets, you should first try to figure out a given
 problem on your own.
- After that, if you're stuck or want to explore alternative approaches,
 feel free to consult with your fellow students, the GSI, and me.
- You should not ask for nor share complete code or solutions
- Basically, you can help each other out, but no one should be doing the
 work for someone else.
- In particular, __your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own__,
and you'll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else's.






### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Email sent for any other reason will NOT be considered or acknowledge.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Academic Honesty

Please see the last section of this document for more information on the
 Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow.

The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:
 "As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity,
 and respect for others." The hope and expectation is that you will adhere
 to this code.

Collaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials
 and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with
 fellow students. This is recommended.
 However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed
 independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result
 of one's own independent work.

__Cheating:__ A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no
 one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating.
 Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a
 failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University
 Center for Student Conduct.
 In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep
 your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during
 the quizzes and exams.

 __Plagiarism:__ To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate
 reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment
 and usually further disciplinary action.
 For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for
 example: [http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html)

__Academic Integrity and Ethics:__ Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two
 common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior.
 Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life.
 They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building
 trust within relationships, whether personal or professional.
 There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines
 what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of
 humanity.
